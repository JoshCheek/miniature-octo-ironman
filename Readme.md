Overview
--------

I want to be able to make ruby-monk style lessons
e.g. https://rubymonk.com/learning/books/4-ruby-primer-ascent/chapters/44-collections/lessons/98-iterate-filtrate-and-transform
This project is to support that.

Getting started
---------------

<table>
  <tr>
    <td> Install dependencies with </td>
    <td> `rake bootstrap` </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Run tests with </td>
    <td> `rake cuke` </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Run server with </td>
    <td> `rake server` (once #11 is done) </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Iteration 1 goals
-----------------

- [ ] I can embed a Ruby snippet into a markdown page and see an editor
- [ ] I can run the code in the editor and see the output (Follow along with progress at #12)

How do I contribute?
--------------------

* Pick an [issue](https://github.com/JoshCheek/miniature-octo-ironman/issues):
  * Look for one that is not assigned
  * Sub issues of #12 would be super helpful :)
  * Also, #2, #11, and #17 are small
* Make a branch to implement the feature
* If it needs tests, make sure it is tested, either way, make sure it doesn't break existing tests, we are currently passing through [this](https://github.com/JoshCheek/miniature-octo-ironman/blob/master/features/omg.feature#L15) step
* Send pull request
* After code review, merge it
* Delete the branch


Future shit maybe
-----------------

* manifest of lesson names to git repositories (ie gist) rather than having to edit the source of the server to change a lesson
* maybe scoped by content owner
* maybe overridable language for the editor
