  # Thoughts:
  #   What if we save/load the manifest in a middleware?
  #   I think that would get us away from these singletons and hacks
  #   Could maybe also pass EvalIn in a middleware, and then in dev provide something that runs locally, and in prod something that actually hits EvalIn
  #
  #   Uhm... I also don't know how to tell what environment we're running in. There's probably some sort of sinatra "set :env, :test" or something, but haven't looked at it yet (this is a brain-dump)
  #
  #   UPDATE! - I didn't read my old thoughts, but there is now a middleware in config.ru and in the OurHelpers module,
  #             we can probably add this to each of those
