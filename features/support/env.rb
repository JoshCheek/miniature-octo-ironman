  # this is going to wipe out any real data we happen to have
  # There is now a middleware to inject eval_in, go there and inject the data dir
  file_helper.reset_datadir

  # Stupid hack because the manifest is a singleton.
  # which causes it to blow up on our tests because we wipe out the data dir
  # so that the tests don't interfere with each other, but this object still has
  # an internal reference to the previous endpoints.

  # We need to load it anew each time a request comes in.
